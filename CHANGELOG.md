# Change Log

## 0.2.0

- Improved collision checks, making it even more of a mess of parentheses (still not completely functional)
- Postponed updates of a player's direction to when a turn actually starts and not 'whenever'; behold the increase in collision bugs
- Added Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Imported everything from the pongo-pandemonium prototype
- Reordered files into folders *client/* and *server/* for slight hierarchy clarity
